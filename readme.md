# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in C++

This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. It provides an overview of Advent of Code, the structure of the solutions, and guidelines for navigating and utilizing the repository.

## Advent of Code Overview

Advent of Code is an annual programming event with daily puzzles released from December 1st to December 25th. Each day offers two problems, challenging participants' programming and problem-solving skills.

## Project Structure

Each day's challenges are in separate directories: `1`, `2`, ..., `25`. Directories include:

- `README.md`: Describes the puzzles and the approach.
- `a.cpp`: C++ solution for the first problem.
- `b.cpp`: C++ solution for the second problem.
- `n.cpp`: n=day (e.g. `1`, `2`, ..., `25`). Sometiems useds instead of `a` and `b` naming convention. Representing the C++ solution for the total solution with a focus on the `b` task.
- `input.txt`: Input data for the problems.

## Goals

The project aims to:

1. **Solve Each Problem:** Provide working solutions for both daily problems.
2. **Experiment with C++:** Explore different aspects of C++.
3. **Enhance Problem-Solving Skills:** Improve algorithmic thinking and problem-solving techniques.
